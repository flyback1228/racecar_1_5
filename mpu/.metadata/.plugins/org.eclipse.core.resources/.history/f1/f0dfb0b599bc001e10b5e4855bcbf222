# Arduino-JY901-Serial
This is a fork of repo [arduino-JY901](https://github.com/BGD-Libraries/arduino-JY901).

The original repo has no update since March 2017, thus I detached my fork and made it an independent one.

## JY901 IMU Demo for Arduino MKR1000/WiFi1010 Serial connection.

### JY901 is a IMU made by Wit-Motion Company.
The original repo [arduino-JY901](https://github.com/BGD-Libraries/arduino-JY901) contains both Serial and IIC connection, 
but this repo focus on the Serial connection and implement all the function given by the official.
